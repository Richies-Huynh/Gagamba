                            Gagamba was founded on a straightforward observation — building
                            maintenance is dangerous, costly, and overdue for disruption.
                            We set out to build autonomous drone technology that removes
                            people from harm's way entirely.

                            Our team brings together expertise across mechanical engineering,
                            civil engineering, and computer science, combining hardware
                            precision with intelligent software to create a drone built for
                            real-world conditions.

                            We've engaged directly with companies in construction and property
                            management to understand the industry's needs and validate our
                            approach. Every decision we make is informed by research and
                            real feedback from the field.

                            matter, Gagamba is building technology that makes buildings safer
                            to maintain and more efficient to operate.
